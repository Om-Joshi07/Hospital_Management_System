# 🏥 Hospital Management System

A Python-based Hospital Management System built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. This console-based project allows hospital staff and admins to perform a variety of operations such as managing doctors and patients, storing data, generating reports, and more.


## 📚 Project Overview

This is a 1st semester project developed to practice and demonstrate core Python OOP concepts like:
1. Classes and Objects
2. Inheritance
3. Encapsulation
4. File Handling
5. Modular Code Design
   
The program allows CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations along with extended functionalities useful for managing a hospital's internal workflow.


## ✅ Features

1. Register/View/Update/Delete Doctor
2. View/Discharge Patients
3. View Discharged Patient
4. Assign Doctor to a Patient
5. Update Admin Details
6. View Patient-Doctor Assigned List
7. View Doctors List
8. Store Data to File
9. Add Patient
10. Load Patient from File
11. Add Symptoms to Patient Profile
12. Relocate Patients (e.g., change room/ward)
13. View Patient by Surname
14. Generate Management Report


## 🧠 Concepts Used

1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Core logic built around classes such as Doctor, Patient, Admin, etc.
2. File Handling: Save and load patient/doctor data to/from files.
3. List & Dictionary Operations: To maintain and manage records efficiently.
4. Modular Code Structure: Separated logic into manageable sections for clarity and future scalability.
